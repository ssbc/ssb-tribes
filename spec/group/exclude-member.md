# `group/exclude-member`

The format of the message being published is the same as [the one that tribes2 uses](https://github.com/ssbc/private-group-spec/blob/64962d2f4b9c2b1b50adc05a7858eda38a73511f/group/exclude-member/schema.json) but the feedId definition has been replaced with the classic sigil feed link, and the groupId has been replaced with the cloaked group link. Also, apart from the actual message, we don't rotate epochs (group secret) on exclusion.
